I'm johnny Achille, I am living in Brazil. I'm a database graduate from Uninove university, I am taking a post-graduate course in data science.
I'm good at communicating and organizing, I really like working in groups.
I've some experience in google cloud, AWS, python, descriptive data analysis, descriptive statistics for data science, SQL, 
databases, power bi, and machine learning, I have already developed several machine learning projects, like classification projects, regression projects, and clustering projects.
I'm interested in learning something new each day, I can say that I'm curious about learning. 
I do like manipulating and visualizing data to gain insights.
