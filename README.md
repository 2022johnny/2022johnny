ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Johnny, a graduate of Uninove University in SÃ£o Paulo. My passion lies at the intersection of SQL, Python, machine learning, generative AI, and data analysis. Whether Iâ€™m exploring data or building innovative models, I thrive on turning insights into actionable solutions.
I'm good at communicating and organizing, I really like working in groups.
I've some experiences in process automation with python,web scraping,descriptive data analysis, descriptive statistics for data analytics,SQL, 
databases,power BI,I have already developed several machine learning projects and data analytics project, like classification projects, regression projects, and clustering projects.
